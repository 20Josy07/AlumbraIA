// Middleware for sanitizing sensitive input data

const sanitizeInputMiddleware = (req, res, next) => {
  // Placeholder for sanitization logic.
  // This could involve removing or masking sensitive fields like 'emergencyContact' before they are processed or stored.
  // Example:
  // if (req.body && req.body.emergencyContact) {
  //   console.log('Sanitizing emergencyContact field (placeholder)');
  //   // Depending on policy, either remove it or hash it, or prevent it from being logged/stored.
  //   // For this app, the policy is to avoid storing it. So, if it's present,
  //   // ensure subsequent logic knows not to persist it, or remove it here.
  //   // delete req.body.emergencyContact; // Or handle appropriately
  // }
